<h2 align="center"> After saving the small village, the villagers approach you.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> They thank you for your help, gifting you with a new sword and shield.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> Taking your gifts, you leave the village and finally arrive in the city.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> As time passes, tales of your heroism spread throughout the city.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> You help the city's people, taking on quests and fighting monsters along the way!</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> It isn't long until the Kingdom recognizes you as a skilled adventurer, and come to you for help.</h2>

	<h2 align="center">The knight announces that the King is gathering a group of adventurers for a quest!</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> An opportunity like this would allow you to become one of the most well-known adventurers in the Kingdom!</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> However, at the same time..</h2>
<h1 align="center"> You notice the same man from the village you saved, talking to a group of farmers.</h1>

	<h2 align="center"> You listen to their conversation, and learn that many of the fields on the far side of the kingdom have been destroyed.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> The farmers point out that the fields were all burned <p style="color: crimson"> and that fires have been spreading out towards The City.</p></h2>
	<h2 align="center">The villager suggests that a group should go out and find the cause of these fires, before it gets closer.</h2>
	
	<h1 align="center">Will you join and help the troubled villagers? Or will you ignore them and see the King?</h1></p>
