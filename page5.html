	<h2 align="center"> You go with them, and search for anyone who is willing to help.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> Eventually, with the group of farmers and villagers you manage to gather, you travel out towards the mountains, where several <p style="color: crimson">mysterious fires</p> had been set.</h2>
	<h2 align="center">You saw the destruction on your journey...</h2>
	
	<h2 align="center"> Ash and smoke covered the farmlands, as well as the surrounding forests.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> You could still feel the warmth of the few flames that remained.</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> The farmers you travel with tell you that the fires have been getting closer to the city...</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> As they do, you hear a loud thunderous sound above you...</h2>
	<h2 align="center"> Looking up, you search the sky for the source of the sound.</h2>
	
	<h2 align="center"> And there in the distance you see..</h2>
	<h1 align="center"><p style="color: crimson">...A Dragon Approaching!</p></h1>
